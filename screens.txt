when clicked on available  schedules we should be redirected to a screen of buses with that schedule/route, so passangers get to choose from the list depending on what time the bus is set to start off, seats availability , amenities aand the like uk ,how it is in bus terminals, then thy can click and trigger the booking flow
add available buses section, where we show buses that are active/onboarding passangers at that current time, with trip info
move the popular routes section to search Screen
we can also add an alert/info section to show users time left till journey, any important news about their journey

on seat selection we need to make sure that the number of seats assigned to a bus by the admin side should reflect in seat selection, and also add real live update on seats selected/booked

on the web refactor the admin dashboard to a card based interface, wea admin can view seats booked,n everything..
